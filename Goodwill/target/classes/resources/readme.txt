1. DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW

The application, Goodwill Donation Tracking System, is designed to store 
the information of each individual inventory item. This information includes:
ID, item category, item description, item condition, items current location,
the date and time of this change of location, as well as the person(s) 
responsible for this change.

The operations that can be done on an item include: registering the item to 
the database of all items, updating an items information, and searching the 
database of items. To see more information about the registration process please
continue to section 2 "Registering an item", to see information about updating 
an item please continue to section 3 "Updating an item", and for information 
about how a search may be done please view section 4 "Searching for item(s)".

2. REGISTERING AN ITEM

To register a new item to the database, click the "Register" button found on
the top left of this window. This will display a form to fill out. 
To fill the ID field, the number can either be typed in through the keyboard 
or by using a bar code scanner attached to the computer via USB connection.
All other fields can be either selected through the provided drop down menu, 
or typed in through the keyboard if applicable. The date and time are 
automatically generated each time the form is refreshed. Once ALL fields have
been filled out, click "Save" to submit the changes and complete the 
registration process. If you would like to clear the text fields, click 
"Clear" to clear and reset all drop down menus to their default values.

3. UPDATING AN ITEM

If the item requires any update, select the "Update" button found on the left 
hand side of this window. 
First, enter the ID manually through the keyboard, or scan the bar code
assigned to the item. Then click the button to the right of that
text field to search for that item's current information.
All fields except for the ID may be edited now. When the location is altered,
a new location is added to the item's history of locations. 
After entering in input to all fields, click "Save" to save the new changes
to the item.
If you wish to clear the entered in  formation, click "Clear" and the form will 
be reset back to when the ID must be entered.

4. SEARCHING FOR AN ITEM

Locate the "Search" button on the sidebar and select this option. When selected
the screen is populated with a table, representing all the items currently 
registered. The table can scroll horizontally to show all the locations the 
item has been to, and where it currently is. To view the entire cell contents,
double click the cell to highlight the text.
To search for a specific item, type the keyword into the provided text field
and click the button next to it, shaped like '>'. If the search returns a partial
match of the keyword, the contents will be displayed in the table.
To view all the registered items again, clear the text field and click the button
again.
